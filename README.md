aaa-001-ext: cluster marked external

aaa-001: internal cluster

same repo for each 'gitrepo' resource

./path1 ./path2 in fleet.io.gitrepo resource aaa-001
NOT duplicate paths NOT duplicate resources, but same git repo hosts both

could be related to -ext naming

should be reflected in fleet-agent?
